-- A named function...
function avg [a b] do
	return div add :a :b 2
end

-- ...can be called like this...
print avg 5 10

-- ...or indirectly like this...
print apply :avg list 5 10

-- ...and is completely equivalent to:
make avg2 fn [a b] do
	return div add :a :b 2
end
-- (Can't reuse the same name.)

-- Just to make sure now.
print avg2 5 10
